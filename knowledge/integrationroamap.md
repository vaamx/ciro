1. Integration with Visualization Components

The main visualization components are located in the dashboard/src/Visualization directory, including various chart types like BarChart, LineChart, PieChart, etc. The ChartProcessor is responsible for preparing data for visualization.

Integration Plan for Visualization Components:

- Connect UniversalDataProcessor with ChartProcessor:
Enhance the parseStructuredResponse method in UniversalDataProcessor to use the 

ChartProcessor for data preparation

This will ensure proper formatting for different chart types

- Implement Support for All Visualization Types:
Extend our ServerAnalyticsService to support all chart types exposed in VisualizationType enum

Make sure that the determineVisualizationType method can recommend all available chart types

- Use ResponsiveVisualization Component:
Update our EnhancedStepByStepVisualization to use the ResponsiveVisualization component
This will ensure charts properly resize on different devices

- Implement LazyVisualizationWrapper:
Use the LazyVisualizationWrapper for better performance when loading visualizations

- This will reduce initial load time and improve UX


2. Integration with RAG System

The RAG System is currently focused on Excel files but needs to support our universal approach.

Integration Plan for RAG System:

Update RAG Prompt Templates:

- Extend PromptTemplates.ts in the RAG service to include templates for all data source types supported in our DataSourceType enum

- Create a new method getUniversalStructuredResponsePrompt() that supports all data types
Modify DirectExcelHandler:

- Generalize the Excel-specific handling to work with our universal approach
Make sure it properly interfaces with our UniversalDataProcessor

- Enhance Entity Detection:
Ensure the EntityDetection.ts functionality works with all data types
Connect it with our ServerAnalyticsService to leverage NLP capabilities


3. Integration with OpenAI Service Prompt Templates

The OpenAI service has its own prompt templates that need to be aligned with our universal approach.

Integration Plan for OpenAI Service:

Consolidate Prompt Templates:

- Update PromptTemplates.ts in the OpenAI service to include our universal structured approach
Ensure consistency between the RAG service prompts and OpenAI service prompts

- Add Analytical Support:
Enhance the getAnalyticalPrompt() method to support all data types
Make it compatible with our ServerAnalyticsService analysis capabilities


4. Integration with Shared Components

Shared components like ProgressIndicator and Toast can enhance the user experience of our Universal Structured Response System.

Integration Plan for Shared Components:

- Implement Progress Tracking:

Use the ProgressIndicator and MultiStepProgress components to show progress during data processing

Add progress tracking to UniversalDataProcessor to enable step-by-step progress visualization

- Add Toast Notifications:

Integrate the Toast component for success/error notifications
Use the ToastProvider to manage notifications globally

- Use ResponsiveContainer:

Wrap our main components in ResponsiveContainer for better layout on different devices
Apply responsive grid to display multiple analytical steps
