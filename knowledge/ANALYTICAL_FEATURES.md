# Enhanced Analytical Capabilities

This document describes the new analytical capabilities added to the chat assistant. These features enable structured analytical responses with visualizations, insights, and step-by-step explanations.

## Features

### 1. Analytical Query Detection

The system automatically detects when a user's query is analytical in nature. Queries that involve:

- Data analysis
- Comparisons
- Trends
- Statistics
- Aggregations
- Patterns
- Visualizations

will trigger the enhanced analytical response format.

### 2. Structured Analytical Responses

Analytical responses are structured into components:

- **Summary**: A concise overview of the analysis findings
- **Analysis Steps**: A step-by-step breakdown of the analytical process
- **Visualizations**: Interactive charts and graphs representing the data
- **Insights**: Key takeaways and actionable intelligence derived from the analysis

### 3. Step Types

Each analytical step can be one of several types:

- **Filtering**: Selection of relevant data
- **Aggregation**: Summarizing or combining data points
- **Grouping**: Organizing data into categories
- **Sorting**: Arranging data in a specific order
- **Visualization**: Representing data visually
- **Comparative**: Comparing different datasets or time periods
- **Insights**: Extracting meaning from the data analysis

### 4. Visualization Types

The system supports multiple visualization types based on the data characteristics:

- Bar charts
- Line charts
- Pie charts
- Scatter plots
- Area charts
- Composed charts (combining multiple chart types)

## How to Use

### Sample Analytical Queries

Here are some examples of analytical queries you can try:

```
Analyze the sales data for the last quarter and compare it with the previous quarter. Show the trends and highlight key insights.
```

```
What were the top-performing products in each region? Visualize the results and suggest areas for improvement.
```

```
Examine customer feedback sentiment by product category over the past year. Identify patterns and notable changes.
```

```
Analyze website traffic patterns over the past 30 days. Break down by source, time of day, and user demographics.
```

### Extending Analytical Capabilities

Developers can extend the analytical capabilities by:

1. Adding new analytical operation types in `analytics-processor.service.ts`
2. Implementing new visualization types in the `Visualization` component
3. Creating custom analytical step processors for domain-specific analyses

## Implementation Details

The analytical capabilities are implemented across several components:

### Backend

- `analytics-processor.service.ts`: Detects analytical queries and determines appropriate operations
- `visualization.service.ts`: Generates visualization configurations
- `chat.controller.ts`: Handles analytical queries and generates structured responses

### Frontend

- `AnalyticalStep.tsx`: Renders individual analysis steps
- `AssistantMessage.tsx`: Displays analytical responses with visualizations
- `Visualization/index.tsx`: Renders different chart types based on the data

## Visualization Library

The system uses [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for rendering visualizations. This library provides a wide range of customizable charts and is integrated seamlessly with React.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the analytical capabilities include:

1. Support for more complex data relationships and visualizations
2. Enhanced data extraction from unstructured sources
3. Predictive analytics and forecasting
4. Customizable visualization themes and styles
5. Export functionality for analyses and visualizations
