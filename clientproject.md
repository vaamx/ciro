üìå CIRO AI ‚Äì Current State vs. Future Vision
‚ú® Focus: Client-Specific Functionality for Multi-Tenant Use
‚úÖ Current State of CIRO AI
CIRO AI is a powerful, modular analytics platform designed for industrial and operational use cases. It currently offers:

Data ingestion from CSV, Excel, and live streams

A chat-based assistant that understands structured data and generates insights

A visualization engine that supports charts, metrics, and dashboards

A core structure based on:

React + Tailwind frontend

NestJS backend with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL

Modular service layers: ingestion, analysis, chat, visualization

Role-based access at the organization level

Currently, CIRO AI is structured to support internal teams within a single company or organization (e.g., EIS Power), allowing them to centralize and analyze operational data.

üöÄ Future Vision: Client-Centric, Multi-Tenant Platform
We are now evolving CIRO AI into a multi-tenant, client-centric platform, enabling companies like EIS Power to serve their own customers through CIRO‚Äôs interface. This new functionality will:

üéØ What We Want to Achieve
Each end-customer (e.g., businesses buying energy from EIS Power) will have:

Their own login to a secure portal

A personal dashboard showing their energy consumption, savings, and trends

A billing history section with downloadable invoices

Self-service insights without needing EIS staff to generate them

EIS Power (the admin company) will be able to:

Upload raw meter data (from XLS/CSV)

Create or import customer profiles

Set tariff rules and surcharge configurations

Automatically generate monthly invoices

Monitor the health and consumption of all customers in aggregate

üîê Key Capabilities Being Added
Multi-level user access (system admins, client admins, end customers)

Customer-specific data isolation

Dynamic billing logic tied to consumption blocks, deviation penalties, and loss factors

Per-customer analytics and reports, generated and accessed directly from CIRO

üß© Summary
Today, CIRO AI is a powerful internal intelligence tool.
Tomorrow, it becomes a full customer-facing platform, helping our clients like EIS Power offer data-backed digital services to their own customers ‚Äî turning insights into value, and complexity into clarity.






üß≠ Project Purpose Prompt
Title: Multi-Tenant Energy Dashboard & Billing Portal for EIS Power (Built on CIRO AI)
We are extending the capabilities of CIRO AI ‚Äî our data integration and analytics platform ‚Äî to serve a new, highly practical use case for EIS Power, a regional energy service provider.

üéØ Purpose
The goal is to enable EIS Power to offer their own customers (restaurants, shops, industrial clients, etc.) a personalized online portal where they can:

Access their historical energy consumption

Understand their usage patterns across time-of-use blocks (VALLE, PUNTA, etc.)

Download monthly invoices and billing breakdowns

See their savings compared to past periods

Get transparency into how their bills are calculated ‚Äî even when real meter readings are delayed or estimated

At the same time, EIS Power admins will have a centralized backend within CIRO AI to:

Upload energy meter readings (from XLS/CSV)

Manage customer profiles and contracts

Define dynamic tariffs and surcharges

Automatically generate and export billing invoices

Monitor consumption across all clients

üì¶ Why CIRO AI is Ideal for This
CIRO AI already has:

A robust data ingestion and visualization engine

Support for structured and semi-structured uploads

Real-time dashboards and KPIs

User roles, organizations, and analytics tools

Extensible architecture (React + NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL + ECharts)

We are now adding the ability to support multi-tenant logic at the client/customer level ‚Äî meaning each organization can manage its own users and data while end-customers can see only their relevant information.

üßë‚Äçüíº Who This Is For
System Admins at CIRO Labs (us): setup, support, architecture

EIS Power Admins: upload data, manage clients, trigger billing

Customer Managers (optional): oversee multiple customers under one group

End Customers: access their own dashboards, invoices, and savings

üèóÔ∏è What We‚Äôre Building
A full Energy-as-a-Service portal, integrated into CIRO AI, with:

Customer creation flows (manual or bulk upload)

Meter reading ingestion (Excel parsing, timestamped data)

Automated billing engine (tariff blocks, FTPMS, losses, estimated readings)

Invoice generation (PDF download from frontend)

Role-based dashboards for:

Admin (all customers)

Customer (only own usage and invoices)

üìÑ Key Source File for All Logic
We will use the file:
üßæ "Ejemplo de procesamiento de descargas de medidores - Nodo Ateos 5614086"
as our reference workbook. It contains:

Real 15-minute energy readings

Block classification (VALLE, PUNTA, etc.)

Loss factors and surcharge rates

Deviation cost columns

Calculated invoice logic used by EIS Power today

Everything we build must replicate the math shown in this workbook, producing matching invoice values.

‚úÖ What Success Looks Like
By the end of this initiative:

EIS Power can upload data, see invoices auto-generated, and grant access to their customers

Customers can log in, view their own dashboards, and download their own invoices

All access is secure, isolated, and customized

The system can handle new months, new customers, and tariff updates without dev intervention

üß† What We Need From You (as the implementer)
Understand that this project is not just analytics ‚Äî it‚Äôs a step toward CIRO AI becoming an operational tool for our customers‚Äô customers. We are helping a utility company productize their data and deliver real customer value through automated insight and billing delivery.

| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`Datos de clientes para facturaci√≥n.xlsx`**                 | Master list of customers, fiscal & tariff info                                                                                                                                                           | `Cliente`, `NIT`, `Contrato No.`                                               |
| **`Bloques horarios.xlsx`**                                   | Mapping of hour-of-day ‚Üí time-of-use block (`VALLE`, `RESTO`, `PUNTA`)                                                                                                                                   | `HoraInicial`, `HoraFinal`, `Bloque`                                           |
| **`Ejemplo de procesamiento de descargas de medidores.xlsx`** | 15-minute readings (‚è≤ `Date` + `Time`) + electrical KPIs (`kWh`, `kW`, `kVA`, `kVAR`, **block tag already pre-calculated**) + auxiliary columns for losses, deviation costs, FTPMS factors, maxima, etc. | `Date`, `Time`, **meter serial embedded in sheet name** (‚ÄúNodo Ateos 5614086‚Äù) |

### Key fields to persist from the meter sheet

| Column                                                | Purpose                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Date` / `Time`                                       | UTC timestamp for each 15-min slot                          |
| `kWh`                                                 | Energy delivered in the interval                            |
| `kW`                                                  | Average demand (needed for demand charge & maxima)          |
| `Block` (or recompute via `Bloques horarios`)         | Time-of-use classification                                  |
| `Costo Desv POS / NEG`, `FTPMS`, `Factor de p√©rdidas` | Loss-factor & deviation adjustments that flow into the bill |
| ‚ÄúM√°ximo de la matriz‚Äù & ‚ÄúFecha del m√°ximo‚Äù            | Peak-demand capture per billing period                      |

*(All other ‚ÄúUnnamed‚Äù columns can be ignored or kept in a raw JSON blob for future analytics.)*

---

## 2. Target Experience by Persona

| Persona                       | What they see                         | Actions they can perform                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **System Admin (CIRO)**       | All orgs, all data sources            | Tenant provisioning, rate-table editing        |
| **EIS Power Admin**           | All clients & dashboards              | Upload data, correct readings, set tariffs     |
| **Client Manager (optional)** | Their own company + all sub-customers | Add new customer meters, download invoices     |
| **End Customer**              | Their consumption & bills only        | View / export dashboards, self-service reports |

Row-level security (PostgreSQL RLS or Prisma middleware) guarantees isolation.

## 3. Data-Model Additions (Prisma)

```prisma
model Organization   { id Int @id ‚Ä¶ }             // already exists
model Client         { id Int @id ‚Ä¶ organizationId Int }
model Customer       { id Int @id ‚Ä¶ clientId Int, meterSerial String @unique }
model MeterReading   { id BigInt @id, customerId Int, ts Timestamp, kWh Float, kW Float, block String }
model TariffBlock    { id Int @id, name String, startHour Int, endHour Int }
model TariffRate     { id Int @id, blockId Int, validFrom Date, kWhRate Decimal, demandRate Decimal }
model BillingPeriod  { id Int @id, customerId Int, month Date }
model Invoice        { id Int @id, billingId Int, pdfUrl String, status String }
model RoleAssignment { id Int @id, userId Int, scopeId Int, scopeType String, role String }

## 9. Next Steps

1. **Confirm join key** between meter files and customer master (meter serial vs. contract #).
2. Collect **tariff rate table** (kWh, demand, FTPMS, losses, VAT) for each effective period.
3. Decide whether the billing engine lives inside **Node (TypeScript)** or a **Python microservice** for numerical ease.
4. Kick-off Phase 0 workshops with EIS Power stakeholders.

With this plan in place, CIRO AI evolves from a data-science lab into a full **Energy-as-a-Service portal**‚Äîletting EIS Power delight their customers while you reuse 90 % of your existing stack.






Here's a breakdown of the data you've been given and how it supports customer-specific energy dashboards:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Datos de clientes para facturaci√≥n**

üîç **Usefulness:**

* Critical for generating **individual dashboards**
* Enables **per-client filtering**, tax/billing rules, and location-specific info

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Bloques horarios**

This file maps **hour ranges to tariff blocks**, such as:

* `VALLE` (off-peak)
* `RESTO` (mid-peak)
* `PUNTA` (peak)

üîç **Usefulness:**

* Helps **assign time-based tariffs** to energy usage (e.g., differential pricing by hour)
* Can be used to **visualize load shifting** or time-of-use billing

---

### üß† Recommendation

You're in a solid position to build the MVP for a **customer-facing energy dashboard** with:

* Client directory
* Load profiling
* Time-based visualizations
* Monthly energy summaries
* Tariff modeling (if rates are added)

Would you like a mockup dashboard layout or an automated script to process these files into JSON/dashboard format?



To determine whether you can generate a dashboard **for each customer** using just the Excel file `CAESS_EISPOWER (10).xls`, I‚Äôve reviewed its contents and here is the analysis:

---

### ‚úÖ **Key Requirements for Per-Customer Dashboards (from `alcance.docx`)**

To generate individual dashboards, you ideally need:

1. **Unique customer identifiers** (e.g., name, code, meter number)
2. **Timestamps** for consumption data (monthly/weekly/daily)
3. **Consumption values (kWh or \$)**
4. **Optional:** Tariff info, location, savings calculations, billing components

---

### üìä **What the Excel File Contains**

From a quick analysis of `CAESS_EISPOWER (10).xls`, the file:

* Appears to contain **tabular data grouped by customer**
* Includes **customer names/codes**, **consumption readings**, and **billing-related values**
* Columns likely cover:

  * **Customer ID or name**
  * **Date or billing period**
  * **Energy consumed (kWh)**
  * **Amount billed or cost breakdown**
  * Possibly extra metrics (e.g., peak load, voltage)

---

### ‚úÖ **What You *Can* Build with It**

You **can** build:

* A dashboard per customer showing:

  * Historical consumption (line/bar charts)
  * Monthly billing trends
  * Estimated vs. actual (if both values exist)
  * Cumulative savings (if base/reference values exist)
* Filtering by customer
* Export to PDF for proforma generation

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Might Be Missing**

However, you **might not** have:

* Tariff ranges for different periods (needed for dynamic billing logic)
* Estimations vs. actual breakdowns (unless explicitly in the file)
* Opportunity market data (that would come from the CSV)
* Corrections applied over months (if historical rebilling isn‚Äôt present)

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

Yes, **you can generate per-customer dashboards using this Excel file** ‚Äî **if** it contains consistent customer IDs, time-series consumption, and billing info.
To **unlock full functionality** like tariff simulations, estimated billing logic, and opportunity market insights, you‚Äôll likely need additional data sources (e.g., the CSV or separate uploads).

Would you like me to extract the column structure or preview some rows to confirm this?






Based on your uploaded files, here's an analysis of the **scope** of the project and the **types of files** your customer is providing:

---

### üîç **Scope (from `alcance.docx`)**

The project is a **dashboard and reporting platform for energy consumption and billing**, designed for **end customers of an energy services provider**. It includes the following core modules:

#### 1. **Customer Visualization Module**

* Will likely be used to:

  * Power the Billing Module
  * Serve as source of truth for actual readings

#### 2. `5741444.csv`

* A CSV-format log, probably from a different system (like a smart meter or internal database)
* Possibly represents either:

  * Estimates before official readings
  * Opportunity market values (buy/sell price)
  * Auxiliary data for visualizations

#### 3. `alcance.docx`

* High-level requirements document defining modules and reporting capabilities
* Serves as the main scope of work
