I would like you to take a look at the way we process information in Large Scales. Inside our Chat, and how we are retreiving large chunks of information.

It is important to note that while I am about to share specific information about a specific file.
We need to keep our solution general. Meaning that we need to improve the extraction logic. and make it more powerful and robut. and not add any mock data or specifics about the following data.

I have a data source currently with called car sales.
My data source contains 23900 lines of just  Volvo Sales.

The Headers include these specific information.
Car_id Date Customer Name Gender Dealer_Name Company Model Engine Transmission Color Price ($) Dealer_No  Body Style Phone Dealer_Region 


So.

I ran a query in my Chat:
What are the total sales for Volvo?

and it returned the wrong amount. 
It seemed it found the data in qdrant but its returning a much shorter list than the one we actually have 

Meaning its filtering a lot of the data out. and filtering out alot of the tables specifics.

and another thing is the the Graphs / Viusalizations that are being produced are considerably wrong. it it using the wrong labels. and not extrcting the most relevant labels. and Data Sources from our file.


Here is an example of the output I get:

Summary
The total sales for Volvo vehicles can be calculated based on the provided sales data. The data includes multiple entries for Volvo with their respective prices.

Steps
Extract Data for Volvo: Identify all entries in the dataset where the company is "Volvo".
Calculate Total Sales: Sum the prices of all identified Volvo entries.
Extracted Data for Volvo
Car_id	Date	Customer Name	Price ($)
C_CND_001001	3/19/2022	Veronica	17000
C_CND_001005	3/19/2022	Vivian	17000

C_CND_002602	5/23/2022	Akram	17000
C_CND_002969	2022-07-06	Ethan	82000
Calculation of Total Sales
Total Sales Calculation:
( 17000 + 17000 + 24000 + 24000 + 21000 + 39000 + 25000 + 36000 + 61500 + 17000 + 82000 = 305500 )
Insights
The total sales for Volvo vehicles amount to $305,500.
The highest individual sale recorded for a Volvo vehicle is $82,000.
Visualization
A suggested visualization could be a bar chart showing the sales price of each Volvo vehicle sold, which would highlight the distribution of sales prices.

Next Steps
Analyze the sales data for other companies to compare total sales.
Investigate the sales trends over time for Volvo vehicles to identify peak sales periods.

Please look deeply into this issue for me. Understand everything we have in our back end processing logic. Like @nlp-processor.service.ts 
@analytics-processor.service.ts @rag.service.ts @statistical-analysis.service.ts 

and more in /home/vaamx/ciro-1/server/src/services

and rendering in our @EnhancedStepByStepVisualization.tsx and @AssistantMessage.tsx 


Take a deep dive into the code, and first help me identify what could be causing these issues and lets create a step by step plan to improve the Search and the Outputs.








Based on my analysis of the code, I can identify several issues affecting your Volvo sales query results:
Key Problems Identified
Limited Data Retrieval: Your RAG system is likely retrieving only a small sample of the data (11 records out of 23,900).
Field Selection Issues: The system isn't correctly identifying the most relevant fields for visualization and analysis.
Inadequate Aggregation: The analytical processing isn't properly summing all sales data.
Poor Visualization Mapping: Charts are using inappropriate labels because the field selection logic isn't optimized.
Weak Insight Generation: The statistical analysis isn't generating meaningful insights from the data.


Root Causes
Looking at the code, these specific issues appear to be the culprits:
In rag.service.ts, there are likely query limits or similarity thresholds restricting the number of documents retrieved.
The retrieveDocuments method in rag.service.ts might be capping results or using a similarity threshold that's too high.
The analyzeQueryIntent function may not be correctly identifying your query as requiring exhaustive results.
In analytics-processor.service.ts, the aggregation logic isn't handling large datasets efficiently.
Field mapping in visualization components isn't intelligently selecting the most relevant fields for display.



Step-by-Step Improvement Plan
1. Enhance Data Retrieval


// In rag.service.ts, modify retrieveDocuments method
private async retrieveDocuments(
  query: string, 
  dataSourceIds: string[],
  needsExhaustiveResults: boolean = false
): Promise<{
  documents: any[];
  collectionNames: string[];
  dataSourceDescriptions: Record<string, string>;
}> {
  // Increase default limit for analytical queries
  const defaultLimit = needsExhaustiveResults ? 10000 : 50;
  
  // Reduce similarity threshold for aggregation queries
  const similarityThreshold = needsExhaustiveResults ? 0.5 : 0.75;
  
  // Rest of the method...
}




2. Improve Query Intent Detection
// In rag.service.ts, enhance analyzeQueryIntent
private analyzeQueryIntent(query: string): {
  isAnalytical: boolean;
  limit: number;
  similarityThreshold: number;
  entityTypes: string[];
  complexity: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  needsExhaustiveResults: boolean; // Add this property
} {
  // Existing code...
  
  // Add detection for aggregation queries that need all data
  const totalPatterns = [
    /total sales/i, 
    /sum of/i, 
    /all sales/i,
    /total revenue/i,
    /total amount/i
  ];
  
  const needsExhaustiveResults = totalPatterns.some(pattern => 
    pattern.test(query)
  );
  
  return {
    // Existing properties...
    needsExhaustiveResults,
    // If we need all results, set a higher limit
    limit: needsExhaustiveResults ? 25000 : 50
  };
}



3. Enhance Field Selection for Visualization


// In analytics-processor.service.ts, improve determineVisualizationType
public determineVisualizationType(query: string, operations: AnalyticalOperationType[], data: any[]): VisualizationType {
  // Existing code...
  
  // Improve field selection by analyzing field data characteristics
  if (data && data.length > 0) {
    // Check if this is a monetary/sales query
    if (/sales|revenue|price|total/i.test(query)) {
      // Look for price fields
      const priceField = Object.keys(data[0]).find(key => 
        /price|\$|cost|amount|sales|revenue/i.test(key)
      );
      
      if (priceField) {
        // Use appropriate visualization for price data
        return 'bar';
      }
    }
    
    // Add more specific field detection logic...
  }
  
  // Default return...
}




4. Enhance Statistical Analysis

// In statistical-analysis.service.ts, improve generateInsights
public generateInsights(data: Record<string, number[]>): StatisticalInsight[] {
  // Existing code...
  
  // Add more meaningful insights for sales data
  if (Object.keys(data).some(key => /price|\$|cost|sales/i.test(key))) {
    const priceKey = Object.keys(data).find(key => /price|\$|cost|sales/i.test(key));
    if (priceKey) {
      const values = data[priceKey];
      const total = values.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
      const avg = total / values.length;
      
      // Add more comprehensive insights
      insights.push({
        id: uuidv4(),
        type: 'general',
        description: `The total ${priceKey} is ${total.toLocaleString('en-US', {
          style: 'currency',
          currency: 'USD'
        })} across ${values.length} records.`,
        confidence: 0.95,
        importance: 0.9,
        relatedVariables: [priceKey]
      });
      
      // Add more insights...
    }
  }
  
  return insights;
}






5. Improve Aggregation Processing
// In analytics-processor.service.ts, enhance processDataWithStatistics
public processDataWithStatistics(
  data: any[],
  operationType: AnalyticalOperationType
): {
  processedData: any[];
  insights: any[];
  visualizationConfig?: Record<string, any>;
} {
  // For aggregation operations, ensure we process all data
  if (operationType === AnalyticalOperationType.AGGREGATION) {
    // Process full dataset with batching for large datasets
    const batchSize = 1000;
    let aggregatedResults = {};
    
    // Process in batches to avoid memory issues
    for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += batchSize) {
      const batch = data.slice(i, i + batchSize);
      // Aggregate batch results
      // ...
    }
    
    // Return aggregated results
  }
  
  // Existing code...
}


6. Improve Visualization Mapping

// In EnhancedStepByStepVisualization.tsx, enhance renderVisualization
const renderVisualization = (vizConfig: any, height = 400) => {
  // Improve field selection for labels
  if (vizConfig && vizConfig.data && vizConfig.data.length > 0) {
    // Auto-detect the best fields for visualization
    const firstRecord = vizConfig.data[0];
    
    // Select appropriate xKey (prefer dates, names, or categories)
    const potentialXKeys = [
      ...Object.keys(firstRecord).filter(k => /date|time|year|month|day/i.test(k)),
      ...Object.keys(firstRecord).filter(k => /name|title|category|model/i.test(k)),
      ...Object.keys(firstRecord).filter(k => /id|code/i.test(k))
    ];
    
    // Select appropriate yKey (prefer numerical values, especially monetary)
    const potentialYKeys = [
      ...Object.keys(firstRecord).filter(k => /price|cost|\$|amount|sales|revenue/i.test(k)),
      ...Object.keys(firstRecord).filter(k => 
        typeof firstRecord[k] === 'number' && 
        !/id|code|year|zip/i.test(k)
      )
    ];
    
    // Update config with better keys if found
    if (potentialXKeys.length > 0 && !vizConfig.xKey) {
      vizConfig.xKey = potentialXKeys[0];
    }
    
    if (potentialYKeys.length > 0 && !vizConfig.yKey) {
      vizConfig.yKey = potentialYKeys[0];
    }
  }
  
  // Existing rendering code...
}






Implementation Recommendations
First Priority: Fix the data retrieval limits in rag.service.ts to ensure we get all relevant records for aggregation queries.
Second Priority: Improve field detection for visualization to ensure we're using the most appropriate data fields.
Third Priority: Enhance the statistical analysis to provide more meaningful insights for large datasets.
Fourth Priority: Improve the visualization component to better handle large datasets and select appropriate chart types.
I recommend implementing these changes incrementally, testing after each major change to ensure we're improving the results without introducing new issues. Would you like me to focus on any specific part of this plan first?
