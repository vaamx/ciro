# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Role-Based Access Control System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the existing CIRO AI authentication system to support the role hierarchy: SYSTEM_ADMIN > CLIENT_ADMIN > CUSTOMER_USER with appropriate permissions and scopes.
# Details:
Extend the existing authentication system to include role-based access control. Use JWT tokens with role and scope claims. Implement NestJS Guards for API endpoint protection. Create the following roles and permissions:

1. SYSTEM_ADMIN: Full access to all resources
2. CLIENT_ADMIN: Access to own client data and all customer data under that client
3. CUSTOMER_USER: Access only to own customer data

Implement using @nestjs/passport with JWT strategy. Use custom decorators for role checks:
```typescript
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles('CLIENT_ADMIN')
@Controller('customers')
export class CustomerController { ... }
```

Store role assignments in the RoleAssignment table with user_id, role, and scope fields.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for auth guards and role decorators. Test each role's access to various endpoints. Verify cross-tenant access prevention. Test token expiration and refresh flows. Create integration tests that simulate complete authentication and authorization workflows.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design JWT token structure with role and scope claims [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extend the existing JWT token structure to include role-based claims and permission scopes for the three-tier hierarchy
### Details:
1. Analyze the current JWT token implementation in the authentication service
2. Define the role hierarchy (SYSTEM_ADMIN > CLIENT_ADMIN > CUSTOMER_USER) in the token payload
3. Design permission scopes for each role level
4. Update the token generation logic to include role and scope claims
5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing token validation
6. Document the new token structure

## Current Authentication System Analysis ✅

**Existing JWT Implementation:**
- JWT strategy with simple payload: `{ userId: string, email: string }`
- Role-based access via Prisma enum and @Roles() decorator
- Basic roles: USER, ADMIN
- JwtAuthGuard and RolesGuard already implemented

**New Role Hierarchy in Prisma Schema:**
- ENERGY_ADMIN, CLIENT_ADMIN, CUSTOMER_USER (added in task 1)
- Multi-tenant structure: Organization → Client → Customer

**Current Limitations:**
- No scope/tenant context in JWT tokens
- No role hierarchy logic in guards
- No client/customer scoping in tokens

**Next Steps:**
1. Extend JWT payload with role and scope claims
2. Update JwtStrategy to handle new token structure
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing system

## JWT Token Structure Implementation Complete ✅

**Enhanced JWT Payload Created:**
```typescript
interface JwtPayload {
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  role: string;
  permissions: string[];
  scopes: {
    organizationId: number;
    clientId?: number;
    customerId?: number;
  };
}
```

**Key Features Implemented:**
1. **Role Hierarchy System** - ENERGY_ADMIN (100) > ADMIN (90) > CLIENT_ADMIN (50) > CUSTOMER_USER (10) > USER (5)
2. **Permission-Based Access Control** - 16 granular permissions (system, org, client, customer, meter, billing, invoice)
3. **Scope-Based Tenant Isolation** - Organization, Client, and Customer-level access control
4. **Backward Compatibility** - Legacy token support maintains existing system functionality
5. **Enhanced Auth Service** - Login method now generates tokens with full role and scope claims

**Role-Permission Mapping:**
- **ENERGY_ADMIN**: Full system access (all 16 permissions)
- **CLIENT_ADMIN**: Client and customer management (13 permissions)  
- **CUSTOMER_USER**: Read-only access to own data (5 permissions)
- **Legacy roles (ADMIN/USER)**: Maintained existing access patterns

**Updated Components:**
- `jwt.strategy.ts` - Enhanced payload interface and validation
- `auth.service.ts` - Token generation with role/scope claims
- `roles.guard.ts` - Hierarchy-based access control
- `role.enum.ts` - Updated to match Prisma schema

**Security Features:**
- Organization membership validation
- Role hierarchy enforcement
- Scope-based access control
- Legacy token support for gradual migration

**Ready for Next Phase:**
All existing authentication endpoints will now generate enhanced tokens while maintaining backward compatibility.
