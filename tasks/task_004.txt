# Task ID: 4
# Title: Setup React Frontend Project Structure
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the React frontend project with Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, and proper organization for multi-tenant UI.
# Details:
Create a React project using Vite for faster development. Install and configure Tailwind CSS v3.x with shadcn/ui components. Set up the project structure with the following directories:

```
src/
  components/
    ui/ (shadcn components)
    layout/
    forms/
    charts/ (ECharts wrappers)
  features/
    auth/
    dashboard/
    customers/
    billing/
    admin/
  hooks/
  services/
  utils/
  contexts/
  types/
```

Configure React Router v6.x for navigation. Set up authentication context for storing user session and role information. Implement a theme provider for consistent styling. Configure Axios for API requests with interceptors for authentication headers.

# Test Strategy:
Set up Jest and React Testing Library for component testing. Create tests for key UI components. Test routing and protected routes. Verify authentication flows in the UI. Test responsive design across different screen sizes.
